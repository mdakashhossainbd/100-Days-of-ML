# When to use: 
    1. Where is conception drift(Data change frequently: Share market)
    2. Cost Effictive
    3. Faster solution: Data trained from data chanck to take less time to train. Possible to train in onine server.

Online Library: 
1. River
2. SKlearn

# Learning Rate: How frequently you will train your model. Very Very important to get the exact output. Set correct learning rate.

# Out of Core Learning: Large amount of data which cant load at-once by Batch learning by your memory. Like 50 GB data in 8GB ram.
Data > Mini Chunks (Offline Process)
model > test > Deploy (Online process)

# Disadvantage: 
    i) Tricky: To get the exact result what we want when frequently getting huge new data.
    ii) Risky: Can change model behavour by spamming data. Determine risk managment factors. Have to active monitoring system like anomaly detection, offline and rollback system.
