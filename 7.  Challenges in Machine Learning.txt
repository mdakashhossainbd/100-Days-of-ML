    # Sample noise:  Take same data form deffirent data.

    # Sampling baise: Take same data from different data but have the same souce.

    # Poor quality of data: 
    # Overfitting: Keeps info during tranning. Don't understand the core concept. Only work well for trained data.
    # Underfitting: 
    # Software Integration
    # Offline learning:
    # Cost Involved
