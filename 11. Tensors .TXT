
Tensor: Is a Data structer. Generally store numbers.
Vector and Matrix is a typeo of Tensor.
0 Dimention: Scaler 
List of number: Vector
2D: Matrix
3D, 4D.........


0D Tensors: (2,3) Scaler

Array == Tensor
No of Dimention == Number of Axis == Rank

1D Tensor = Vector
([1,2,3,4]) 1D Tensor = 4D Vector


2D Tensor == 2 Axis == Matrix == Rank 2
	[1,2,4] 
	[4,5,6] 
	[2,9,4]


Rand,Axes and Shape
No of axis = rank = Dimention
Shpae = Maximum item in a perticular Axis
size = total items

shape = rank * row * column
