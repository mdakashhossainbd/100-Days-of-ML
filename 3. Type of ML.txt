Type of ML

Data:
1. Numerical: Age, CGPA, IQ.
2. Categorical: Gender, Nation, Color.

1. Supervised ML: When we have both Input and Output to find thier mathmetical relationship so than we can predict a output for new input data.
	1. Regression: Have many numerical input data. Have to give ouput/target to Numerical Supervised oputput.
`	2. Classification: Have many numerical input data. Have to give ouput/target to Categorical Supervised oputput

2. Unsupervised: Only have input data - Don't have output so you get confused what to do! You can do this 4 things -
	1. Clustering: Divide input data in several gropus so that can get clear idea about the datas categories.
	2. Dimentionality Reduction: When have too many column/feature then this technique take 2 column and merge them together in a single column. Also called as feature extraction.
		# Visulation: Lets have too many dimentional data then it shrink all dimentions in 2 or 3D to visulize same things.       
	3. Anomaly Detection: Detect outliers.
	4. Association rule learning: When theres have too many data then it will find Association among them. And depend on it will arrange datas efficently.

3. SemiSupervised: Need to Lebel few data manually then the Unsupervised learning will level remain data by itself.
4. Reinforcement Learning: No data provided. Agent learned by reward-punishment process. Start learning from zero.
